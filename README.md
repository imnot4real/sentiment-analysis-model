sentiment analysis model for movie reviews

To run this project:

First, ensure you have a CSV file named movie_reviews.csv in the same directory as these scripts. The CSV should have two columns: 'review' (containing the text of the review) and 'sentiment' (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

Install the required packages:
```
Copypip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the main script:
```
Copypython main.py
```
